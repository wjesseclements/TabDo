# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

TabDo is a minimalist Firefox browser extension that transforms the new-tab page into a to-do list with three columns: Daily, Recurring Daily, and Weekly.

**Repository:** https://github.com/wjesseclements/TabDo

## Key Constraints

- **Privacy-First:** NO external APIs, cloud services, or network requests
- **Local Storage Only:** Use browser.storage.local API exclusively
- **Performance:** <200ms load time, <50ms task operations
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only SortableJS for drag-and-drop
- **Browser:** Firefox â‰¥109 (Manifest v3) primary target

## Project Structure

```

## Technology Stack

- TypeScript 5.x (strict mode enabled)
- Vite 5 for building
- Vanilla TypeScript (no framework - optimized for performance)
- SortableJS for drag-and-drop (lazy loaded)
- Jest + Testing Library for tests
- No CSS frameworks - vanilla CSS only

## Development Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start dev server with HMR
npm run build       # Production build to dist/
npm run test        # Run test suite
npm run type-check  # TypeScript validation
npm run lint        # ESLint checks
npm run extension   # Load in Firefox for testing
```

## Coding Conventions

- Use functional components with hooks (if React)
- Prefer const over let, never use var
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Name event handlers: handleXxx
- CSS classes: kebab-case
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Interfaces: PascalCase with 'I' prefix (e.g., ITask)

## Data Model

```typescript
interface ITask {
  id: string;          // UUID v4
  text: string;        // Task description
  checked: boolean;    // Completion state
  createdAt: number;   // Unix timestamp
  order: number;       // Display order
}

interface IAppState {
  version: 1;
  lists: {
    daily: ITask[];
    recurringDaily: ITask[];
    weekly: ITask[];
  };
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  lastReset: number;   // Unix timestamp
}
```

## Critical Business Logic

1. **Reset Rules (midnight local time):**
   - Daily: DELETE all checked items
   - Recurring Daily: UNCHECK all items (preserve)
   - Weekly: NO automatic reset

2. **Task Operations:**
   - New tasks prepend (most recent first)
   - Drag only within same list
   - Immediate save to storage on any change

3. **Theme Logic:**
   - Default to system preference
   - Manual override persists
   - Smooth 250ms transition

## Performance Requirements

- First meaningful paint: <200ms
- Task operations: <50ms
- Drag animations: 60fps
- Storage writes: debounce 100ms

## Testing Strategy

- Unit test all pure functions
- Integration test storage operations
- E2E test critical user flows
- Mock browser.storage.local in tests

## Common Tasks

When implementing features:
1. Always check PRD section first
2. Write tests before implementation
3. Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
4. Test both light/dark themes
5. Verify <200ms performance target

## Git Workflow

- Branch from main: `feature/description`
- Commit format: `type: description` (feat/fix/docs/test)
- PR requires: passing tests, performance check
- Squash merge to main

## Error Handling

- Gracefully handle storage quota errors
- Show user-friendly messages
- Never lose user data
- Log errors to console (dev only)

## Security Considerations

- Sanitize all user input (XSS prevention)
- No eval() or innerHTML with user data
- Content Security Policy in manifest
- Minimal permissions requested

## Accessibility

- WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance
- Full keyboard navigation
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Test with screen readers

## Build & Release

1. Run full test suite
2. Build production bundle
3. Test in Firefox manually
4. Update version in manifest.json
5. Update CHANGELOG.md
6. Create GitHub release
7. Submit to AMO (addons.mozilla.org)

## Known Gotchas

- Firefox storage.local has 10MB limit
- Manifest v3 requires service workers (not background scripts)
- SortableJS needs specific Firefox touch handling
- Dark theme requires explicit color-scheme CSS

## Manual Firefox Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Firefox version 109 or higher
- Node.js installed (for building the extension)

### Step-by-Step Loading Instructions

#### 1. Build the Extension
```bash
# Navigate to the TabDo directory
cd /Users/jc/dev/tabdo

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Build the production version
npm run build
```

#### 2. Load Extension in Firefox

**Method 1: Using web-ext (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install web-ext globally if not already installed
npm install -g web-ext

# Run the extension in a temporary Firefox profile
npm run extension
# OR manually:
# web-ext run --source-dir=dist --target=firefox-desktop
```

**Method 2: Manual Loading (Alternative)**
1. Open Firefox
2. Navigate to `about:debugging`
3. Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
5. Navigate to the `/Users/jc/dev/tabdo/dist/` directory
6. Select the `manifest.json` file
7. Click "Open"

#### 3. Test the Extension

**Initial Load Test:**
1. Open a new tab (Ctrl/Cmd + T)
2. The TabDo interface should appear instead of the default new tab page
3. Check browser console (F12) for performance metrics:
   - Look for "TabDo Performance Metrics" log entry
   - Verify load time is under 200ms
   - Check for any error messages

**Core Functionality Testing:**

**Task Management:**
- Add tasks to each column (Daily, Recurring Daily, Weekly)
- Edit tasks by double-clicking or using the edit button
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete using checkboxes
- Delete tasks using the delete button
- Drag and drop tasks to reorder within the same column

**Settings Panel:**
- Click the settings gear icon in the top right
- Test theme switching (Light, Dark, System)
- View keyboard shortcuts
- Test "Clear All Data" functionality

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl/Cmd + 1`: Focus Daily tasks input
- `Ctrl/Cmd + 2`: Focus Recurring Daily tasks input
- `Ctrl/Cmd + 3`: Focus Weekly tasks input
- `Ctrl/Cmd + ,`: Open Settings
- `Esc`: Close modal/settings
- `Enter`: Add task or save edit
- `Double-click`: Edit task

**Reset Logic Testing:**
1. Add some tasks to Daily and Recurring Daily lists
2. Check some tasks as complete
3. Change your system time to the next day (or wait until midnight)
4. Open a new tab to see reset behavior:
   - Daily: Completed tasks should be deleted
   - Recurring Daily: All tasks should be unchecked
   - Weekly: No changes

**Accessibility Testing:**
- Test keyboard navigation with Tab key
- Test screen reader compatibility (if available)
- Verify focus indicators are visible
- Test high contrast mode support

**Performance Testing:**
- Monitor console for performance warnings
- Test with many tasks (add 20+ tasks to each list)
- Check task operation speed (should be under 50ms)
- Test drag & drop performance

**Theme Testing:**
- Test light theme appearance
- Test dark theme appearance
- Test system theme automatic switching
- Verify smooth transitions between themes

#### 4. Development Testing

**With Hot Reload:**
```bash
# For development with auto-reload
npm run dev
# Then load the extension using about:debugging pointing to dist/
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for performance metrics on each page load
- Check for warnings about performance thresholds
- Monitor task operation timing

### Troubleshooting

**Extension Won't Load:**
- Verify Firefox version is 109+
- Check that `npm run build` completed successfully
- Ensure `dist/manifest.json` exists
- Check browser console for error messages

**Performance Issues:**
- Check console for performance warnings
- Verify SortableJS is loading properly for drag & drop
- Monitor storage operation timing

**Theme Issues:**
- Test system theme detection
- Verify CSS custom properties are working
- Check for proper dark mode color scheme

**Storage Issues:**
- Check browser console for storage errors
- Test with browser storage inspector (F12 > Storage tab)
- Verify data persists between sessions

### Expected Behavior
- New tab page should load in under 200ms
- All task operations should complete in under 50ms
- Smooth 250ms theme transitions
- Responsive design on different screen sizes
- Full keyboard accessibility
- Screen reader announcements for all actions

The extension should work seamlessly as a new tab replacement with all productivity features functional.
